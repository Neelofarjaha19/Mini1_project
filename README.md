Land cover change detection using Multispectral images

Land cover change detection with multispectral images is an important remote sensingapplication that involves evaluating changes in the physical and biological features of the Earth's surface as time goes on. Satellite sensors that capture data in multiple bands of the electromagnetic spectrum typically acquire multispectral images, allowing for theidentification and monitoring of different kinds of land cover, such as forests, crops, urban areas, bodies of water, and bare land. Change detection implies comparing two multitemporal satellite images to look for any differences between the two timestamps. We implemented two approaches for obtaining changes between two satellite photos. The first approach includes KMeans clustering and the second approach includes Gaussian mixture model. These algorithms generate the color maps as output as to where the changes can be identified.
